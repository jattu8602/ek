# admin products adding  -
/product -  there is a button for adding button  after clicking on it a new page opens up where admin will be adding products based on category and sub category

you have to enter predefined categories and sub categories -
Category,Subcategories
Seeds, - "Maize, Paddy, Wheat, Vegetable"
Fertilizers,- "Micronutrients, Majornutrients, Organic"
Crop Protection, - "Herbicide, Insecticide, Fungicide, Seed Treatment"
tools - this gonna be only category no sub category is there  so we can directly add products to tools easily okay


add all the required fields  here as the ui  - any product you can see (http://localhost:3000/product/pioneer-maize-3355)  in /product/[slug]/page.jsx


one extra advantage here we will be giving to admins is either he can upload the photoes by own  or by ai ---- based on the title the ai(gemini) will search images from google  and admin can select the photoes from there  admin can select multiple photoes too and add the photo there - admin can add extra photoes anytime  , admin can delete the existing photoes anytime  - all the photoes gonna be uploaded in cloudinary and link is stored in mongodb
